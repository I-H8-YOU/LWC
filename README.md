# 🌩️ LWC Practice – From Basics to Real Projects
🔰 **Goal**: Practice core LWC concepts gradually – from inputs and data binding to Apex integration and component architecture.

---

## 📚 Progress

###  Step 01 – Basic Input & Reactive Data
- `helloUser/`: Input your name and display a greeting (`Hello, [Name]!`)
- `counterComponent/`: Simple counter with +1 and -1 buttons
- 🔗 Concepts: Data binding, reactive variables, event handling

---

###  Step 02 – Component Communication
- `parentComponent/` + `childComponent/`: Parent passes data to child (`@api`)
- Child emits custom event to parent on button click
- 🔗 Concepts: Props, custom events, event bubbling

---

###  Step 03 – To-Do List App
- `todoList/`: Add and delete tasks dynamically
- 🔗 Concepts: `for:each`, `key`, `if:true`, dynamic rendering

---

###  Step 04 – Apex Integration
- `accountSearch/`: Fetch Account records from Apex and search by keyword
- 🔗 Concepts: `@wire`, `@AuraEnabled`, Apex calls from LWC

---

###  Step 05 – Mini Project: Contact Manager
- `contactList/`: View saved contacts
- `contactForm/`: Add new contacts
- `contactItem/`: Display individual contact cards
- 🔗 Concepts: Full CRUD structure, modular LWC design, component splitting
